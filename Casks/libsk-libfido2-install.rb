  caveats do
    <<~EOS
      The launch agent sets SSH_SK_PROVIDER, SSH_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE
      for your login session, so terminals opened after logging in inherit them.

      Sessions that do not inherit the launchd environment need the variable
      set explicitly, so the provider path is also added to the console user's
      ~/.zshrc.

      If you use another shell, or another account, add this yourself:
        export SSH_SK_PROVIDER=/usr/local/lib/libsk-libfido2.dylib
    EOS
  end
